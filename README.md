## Feedback

Your purpose audience and goal was defined and thought out. Combining both photography and web development portfolios is a great idea and I cant wait to see the results. That being said be careful of scope creep. I would also recomend spending extra time thinking about how you want to layout your portfolio section. You might want to consider having one or two more extra pages but no more than four. The use case could have used a little more work. I would recomend spending more time documenting how your persona interacted with the site. Your HTML and directory structure was also perfect
