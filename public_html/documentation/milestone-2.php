			<p> The site will be one page with the following sections:</p>
			<p>
				Home Page: The top of the page will have the title, a nav bar to direct a user to the different sections, and a slide show
			</p>
			<p>
				About Me Section: I would like the title to swing left with a circular image of me on the right. As well as a short and sweet text about me like an elevator speech.
