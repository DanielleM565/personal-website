She works for the government and lives comfortably on the west side of town with her fiance. She's looking for some of my photos featuring couples in weddings and engagement sessions. Cherish is looking for someone with an artistic style who will fit in like she's part of the family at the wedding. She would like someone with a warm personality but also very professional. She wants photos that she will keep forever, in scrapbooks, frames on the mantel and to post on social media.
